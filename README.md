# mineField_HTTPServer
Building a HTTP Server with a MineField application..

The HTTP Server was built using Python's socket library and the game was developed with the usual tools of web programming (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

It's needed to change the HOST value on servidor.py to your computer IP Addres. If the PORT is already in use, change its value to another unoccupied random number.

To run this project, it is recommended to open your OS Terminal and run only the python file (servidor.py) through the command below without quotation marks
: <br> <br>
"python3 servidor.py"
